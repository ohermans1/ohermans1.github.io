Created using Vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript, this 'Project To Do'
            list is something I use day to day to record notes and ideas for new
            projects.<br />When a project is added using the input at the top of
            the screen, it is assigned an creation date and is stored in an
            array in local memory, so that it will remain even if you close and
            reopen the website. <br />Projects can be dragged between the
            different status fields, and the 'At a Glance' counter keeps track
            of how many projects are at each status. <br />If you click on a
            created project, you can add notes in a free text field, which is
            also stored in local memory automatically when you close the project
            pop-up modal. <br />This page also features a dark and light mode
            variation, which can be toggled with a switch at the bottom of the
            page.
